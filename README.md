GUCera is an open online course provider that offers massive open online courses and certificates. Instructors can upload courses content for students in any field. Students are allowed to take any course they like according to their course level then receive a final grade and a certificate based on their grades
in the course. GUCera needs a system for managing online courses given to students by instructors.
The aim of the project is to implement an Online Courses website that provides these features to students
and professors.

You can watch a walkthrough of the website from [Here](https://youtu.be/Yp8k0miwOnU).
